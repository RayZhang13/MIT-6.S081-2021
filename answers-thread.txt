If two CPUs are to insert a new entry node to the current bucket which is a linked list, 
both might excute "e->next = n;" before either excutes "*p = e;". 
In such case, there would then be two entry nodes with next set to the former list head.
When the two assignments to *p happen, the second one will overwrite the first; 
the entry node involved in the first assignment will be lost.
